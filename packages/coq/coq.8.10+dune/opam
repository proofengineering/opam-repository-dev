synopsis: "The Coq Proof Assistant"
description: """
Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides
a formal language to write mathematical definitions, executable
algorithms and theorems together with an environment for
semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical
applications include the certification of properties of programming
languages (e.g. the CompCert compiler certification project, or the
Bedrock verified low-level programming library), the formalization of
mathematics (e.g. the full formalization of the Feit-Thompson theorem
or homotopy type theory) and teaching.
